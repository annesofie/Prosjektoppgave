TB!
%A big problem with OSM is finding a good, fast and easy way of correcting data. There exists multiple tools that finds possible errors, but there also has to be a good way of fixing them. A solution to this problem can be can be microtasking. Microtasks are formed basically by dividing a project into smaller tasks, clearly defined, that can be performed independently \cite{EstellesArolas}.  

\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Voluntary acquisition of data for digital mapping has become quite popular over the last years. This is also a cornerstone for Open Street Map (OSM), which is a global open access database for digital maps. To establish data sets (for maps) is a comprehensive task. By dividing the work into many small sub-tasks, each of these tasks may be possible to handle by voluntary enthusiasts. This is called Microtasking.

The Norwegian government has indicated that the most detailed map data for Norway (FKB) may become freely available within a few years. If so, these data may be included in the database of OSM.   

\textit{During this paper the student is suppose to:} \\
- Study relevant literature \\
- Study how Microtasking is working \\
- Explore how data from FKB can be mapped into OSM \\
- Investigate if Microtasking is a possible method for including FKB in OSM \\


%This paper will inform you on the technical challenges regarding OpenStreetMap and governmental data \cite{Exel2010}. For a summary of papers you can see on page \pageref{sec:wang}

%In theory micotasking seems to solve a lot of OSM problems like overlapping data, deletion of good metadata (read: tags) when running import-scripts and makes it easier to control, both the workflow and quality of the data. Microtasking splits a task into multiple subtasks and distributing these subtasks to humans over the internet.  The OSM mindset  of schema-less datasets and tags differs from many organizations. With the success of OSM it is time to start taking this mindset serious. OSM also has its weaknesses , but many people believe microtasking solves the majority of them. By using FKB building dataset I will try too look further into mapping governmental data over to the OSM format, also trying to experience if microtasking is the solution of the weaknesses of OSM, like the ones I mentioned above.

%Suggested method for importing FKB to OSM 
	% Går tilbake til metodene, hva kan vi lære i Norge hvor vi ikke har Mapbox. Norske FKB er bedre enn de man har importert i andre land
	% Se på scriptene 
	% Her ta mappingen over til OSM , lua filen
	% Hvordan dele opp i tasking områder, telle antall hus. 50-30-20 hus innenfor hver task?
	% Dette er en utfordring, men er utenfor scopet til oppgaven. Komme med noen tanker rundt hvordan det kan løses.
