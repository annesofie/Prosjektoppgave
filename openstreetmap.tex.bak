TB!
%A big problem with OSM is finding a good, fast and easy way of correcting data. There exists multiple tools that finds possible errors, but there also has to be a good way of fixing them. A solution to this problem can be can be microtasking. Microtasks are formed basically by dividing a project into smaller tasks, clearly defined, that can be performed independently \cite{EstellesArolas}.  

\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Voluntary acquisition of data for digital mapping has become quite popular over the last years. This is also a cornerstone for OpenStreetMap (OSM), which is a global open access database for digital maps. To establish data sets (for maps) is a comprehensive task. By dividing the work into many small sub-tasks, each of these tasks may be possible to handle by voluntary enthusiasts. This is called micro-tasking.

The Norwegian government has indicated that the most detailed map data for Norway (FKB) may become freely available within a few years. If so, these data may be included in the database of OSM. This paper will look at the FKB building datasets.    

An import of FKB building data could result in a 3D modell of the entire country, free and available for everyone. FKB contain very detailed building data and gives a good foundation for 3D modelling of buildings. Trondheim will be a test municipality in this paper. Here buildings are today added manually by users drawing over aerial photos. Height and roof shape is not included, making 3D modelling of buildings very difficult. An example of 3D modeling of buildings in Trondheim added manually from aerial photo is shown in figure \ref{fig:3Dekstrd}.

    \label{fig:3Dekstrd}
\end{figure}  

The same buildings 3D modeled with FKB building data is shown in figure \ref{fig:3DekstrdFKB}. This model is created by Norkart.

Importing data into OSM can be tricky and finding the most optimal approach is not easy. An import should always follow the OSM import guidelines. In OSM imports must be planned and executed with more care and sensitivity than other edits. A bad import can have significant impacts on both existing data and the local mapping community. Finding a balance between manual verification and automatic import is the key. An import should not demand more time than manually drawing buildings into OSM. %The import should require more work than a manual import. 
When importing data into OSM the team needs a plan on how to The micro-tasking method may be a solution. Two big building imports has used this method and this paper will look at how they did it, and how it worked and what didn't work. 

\textit{During this paper the student is suppose to:} \\
- Study relevant literature \\
- Study how Microtasking is working \\
- Explore how data from FKB can be mapped into OSM \\
- Investigate if Microtasking is a possible method for including FKB in OSM \\



%In theory micotasking seems to solve a lot of OSM problems like overlapping data, deletion of good metadata (read: tags) when running import-scripts and makes it easier to control, both the workflow and quality of the data. Microtasking splits a task into multiple subtasks and distributes these subtasks to humans over the internet.  The OSM mindset  of schema-less datasets and tags differs from many organizations. With the success of OSM it is time to start taking this mindset serious. OSM also has its weaknesses , but many people believe microtasking solves the majority of them. By using FKB building dataset I will try too look further into mapping governmental data over to the OSM format, also trying to experience if microtasking is the solution of the weaknesses of OSM, like the ones I mentioned above. 


\chapter{Background}
There are two types of people in the free and open source software for Geoinformatics community: Those who have an geomatics background and learned ICT afterwards and those who have an ICT background and learned geomatics on their own afterwards. The last type has a much higher percentage in the OSM community. 

%Importing FKB data into OpenStreetMap would increase the coverage in Norway tremendously....

	% Se på scriptene 
	% Her ta mappingen over til OSM , lua filen
	% Hvordan dele opp i tasking områder, telle antall hus. 50-30-20 hus innenfor hver task?
	% Dette er en utfordring, men er utenfor scopet til oppgaven. Komme med noen tanker rundt hvordan det kan løses.
