abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a volunteer-driven, globally distributed organization whose members work to create a common digital map of the world. OSM embraces ideals of open data, and to that end innovates both socially and technically to develop practices and processes for coordinated operation. This paper provides a brief history of OSM and then, through quantitative and qualitative examination of the OSM database and other sites of articulation work, examines organizational growth through the lens of two catastrophes that spurred enormous humanitarian relief responsesâ€”the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda. The temporally- and geographically- constrained events scope analysis for what is a rapidly maturing, whole-planet operation. The first disaster identified how OSM could support other organizations responding to the event. However, to achieve this, OSM has had to refine mechanisms of collaboration around map creation, which were tested again in Typhoon Yolanda. The transformation of work between these two events yields insights into the organizational development of large, data-producing online organizations.},

abstract = {Crisis mapping is a new modality of participatory humanitarian action in which global publics are mobilized to trace digital maps of disaster-stricken sites and to classify, verify, and plot on maps Big Data produced by disaster-affected people. This article untangles the political rationalities behind this emergent form of digital humanitarianism by looking at two platforms that shape the self-organizing crowds in which crisis mapping is grounded: MicroMappers, a microtasking platform for processing messages from disaster zones, and the Missing Maps Project, which traces maps of disaster-prone areas in poor countries. While looking at the increasingly prominent interplay between device-based participation and technologies of advanced liberal governance in humanitarianism, I make two interrelated claims. First, I argue that ICTs do not promote the democratization of disaster response as much as they put at its disposal new tools for establishing order and security in crisis zones by facilitating the transfer of responsibility to humanitarian crowds. Second, I claim that the emergence of the crowd as a new humanitarian actor that serves the dual and potentially incommensurate purposes of resilience and witnessing perpetuates the ambiguities of a humanitarian endeavor whose inherent tensions had grown deeper since it gained its current political prominence. Since its breakthrough following the Haiti earthquake (2010), crisis mapping has become established as a promising new avenue of both disaster management and humanitarian engagement. Described as a citizen-based and democratized creation of ''live,'' ''dynamic,'' and ''interactive'' maps that capture the unfolding of everything ''from slow-burn crises to sudden-onset disasters'' (Meier, 2011, 2012), crisis mapping has been repeatedly applied around the world to digitally trace maps of building, roads, displaced people's camps and medical facilities in the wake of disaster, to aggregate and plot on maps Big Data reports on humanitarian needs, and to assess damages based on aerial imagery. Following its tentative beginnings in the Haiti quake, when thousands of volunteers mobilized to make sense of the huge volume of data that flowed from the country via social media and text messages as well as to trace the most detailed street map of Haiti ever created, crisis mapping has become embedded in a global apparatus that encompasses international agencies, nonprofit tech companies, academic institutions, open source volunteer networks, and business corporations. In the weeks following the earthquake in Nepal in April 2015, for example, more than 4000 volunteers added over 13,199 mile of roads to the OpenStreetMap map of Nepal in an effort coordinated by the local Kathmandu Living Labs; at least nine teams flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operated in the country to produce up-to-date aerial imagery of damages; six million tweets were automatically processed in search of relevant info; and no less than 52 different crisis maps were created by a plethora of governmental, business, and grassroots actors.},

abstract = {The wide availability of technologies such as GPS, map services and social networks, has resulted in the proliferation of geospatial data on the Web. In addition to material produced by professionals (e.g., maps), the public has also been encouraged to make geospatial content, including their geographical location, available online. The volume of such user-generated geospatial content is constantly growing. Similarly, the Linked Open Data cloud includes an increasing number of data sources with geospatial properties. The geo-referencing of Web resources and users has given rise to various services and applications that exploit it. With the location of users being made available widely, new issues such as those pertaining to security and privacy arise. Likewise, emergency response, context sensitive user applications, and complex GIS tasks all lend themselves toward Geospatial Semantic Web solutions. Researchers have been quick to realize the importance of these developments and have started working on the relevant research problems, giving rise to new topical research areas such as "Geographic Information Retrieval", "Geospatial (Semantic) Web", "Linked Geospatial Data", "GeoWeb 2.0". Similarly, standardization bodies such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) have been developing relevant standards such as the Geography Markup Language (GML) and GeoSPARQL. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, as well as interested parties from industry and government, to advance the frontiers of this exciting research area. Bringing together Semantic Web and geospatial researchers helps encourage the use of semantics in geospatial applications and the use of spatial elements in semantic research and applications thereby advancing the Geospatal Web},
